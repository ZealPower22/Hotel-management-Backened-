# Hotel-management-Backened-

This C-based Hotel Management System backend handles room bookings, availability checks, guest information, and billing. It stores data in a text file for persistence and allows adding, updating, or deleting booking records. Users can book rooms by providing guest details and check-in/check-out dates, and the system generates bills based on the stay duration and room type
